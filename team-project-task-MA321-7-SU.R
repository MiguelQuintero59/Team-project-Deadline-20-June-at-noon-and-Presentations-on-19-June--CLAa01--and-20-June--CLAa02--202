# Coursework MA321-7-SU: Team Project Task - R Code to Get Started
# Version:May 2025
rm(list=ls())
# --- Setup ---
# Set your working directory to the folder where your data is stored
# Example: setwd("path/to/your/directory")
# If you're using a University lab computer, ensure you save your work on your network drive 
# or back it up using cloud storage (e.g., Apple iCloud, Google Drive) or a USB stick.
# Always keep multiple backups of your work to prevent data loss.

# --- Load Data ---
# Copy the file "gene-expression-invasive-vs-noninvasive-cancer.csv" from Moodle to your working directory

InitialData <- read.csv(file = "gene-expression-invasive-vs-noninvasive-cancer.csv")

# --- Check the Data ---
# Use the following commands to understand the structure and dimensions of the dataset
str(InitialData)
# Output Example:
# 'data.frame': 78 obs. of 4773 variables
# $ X             : int  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...
# $ J00129        : num  -0.448 -0.48 -0.568 -0.819 ...
# $ Contig29982_RC: num  -0.296 -0.512 -0.411 -0.267 ...
# $ Contig42854   : num  -0.1 -0.031 -0.398 0.023 ...

dim(InitialData)  # Returns dataset dimensions (rows and columns)
# Example Output:
# [1] 78 4773

dimnames(InitialData)[[2]][4770:4773]  # View the names of the last columns
# Example Output:
# [1] "NM_000895" "NM_000898" "AF067420" "Class"

# Summary of the dataset:
# - 78 rows (patients)
# - 4773 columns: 4772 columns represent gene expression measurements, 
#   and column 4773 contains the "Class" variable (values: 1 or 2).

# Check the distribution of the "Class" variable
table(InitialData[, 'Class'])
# Example Output:
# Class
#   1   2 
#  34  44 



# --- Randomization Setup ---

# The script assigns a subset of variables to each team.
# In the file 'teamsubsets.csv', each team number is associated with 500 columns (variables).

# Load the file 'teamsubsets.csv', which contains the numbers of the teams 
# and their associated variable subsets.
teamsubsets <- read.table('teamsubsets.csv')

# Specify the number of your team to identify your teams's subset of variables.
# Replace 50 by the number of your team.

your_team <- 50

my_team_subset <- teamsubsets[your_team,]
str(my_team_subset)
# Extract the subset of variables for the number of your team.
# The result is a vector of 500 variables associated with the number of your team.

print(my_team_subset) # Print your team's subset of variables.

# Assume that InitialData is the preloaded dataset containing the original variables.

Class <- InitialData$Class # Extract the "Class" column, which represents the labels or targets.

# Select only the columns (variables) specified in the subset (my_subset).
X <- InitialData[, as.integer(my_team_subset)]

# Combine the "Class" column with the selected variables to create the final dataset.

MyTeam_DataSet <- cbind(Class, X)

# The dataset 'MyTeam_DataSet' contains:
# - The "Class" column as the first column.
# - The 500 variables associated with your team number.

str(MyTeam_DataSet)

#

dim(MyTeam_DataSet)

# The data set has 78 rows (observations/patients) and 501 variables (class variable and 500 features/genes)

dimnames(MyTeam_DataSet)[[2]]

# For example with team number 50 you get
# > dimnames(MyTeam_DataSet)[[2]]
# [1] "Class"          "X98260"         "Contig26706_RC" "NM_002923"      "AL137736"

# [501] "NM_002729"
